# ps2_assignment3

The assignment tests the ability to develop and analyze secure protocols with a focus on cryptography. The aim is to gain experience in packet sniffing and to implement a secure protocol using Python. The assignment involves transmitting encrypted values through an open channel and decrypting them at the destination while ensuring their correctness. The security weaknesses of the original Python API will be demonstrated using a WLAN sniffing tool like Wireshark. The task involves designing an efficient Chosen Ciphertext Attack (CCA) secure protocol that uses blockcipher to achieve both confidentiality and message integrity simultaneously. The assignment will require the submission of a 1-page report that summarizes the technique used, its efficiency and security trade-offs, and a step-by-step explanation of the implementation.
