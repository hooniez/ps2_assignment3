Web applications
Client/server over the web.
Mobile endpoints.
There are also embedded endpoint devices. Which are stored in firmware.

#### Development methodologies.
Security must be taken into account at all stages of software development.
Requirments must first be developed.
Then technical design.
Different methodolgies.
Waterfall model
Spiral model
Agile model


#### Maturity Models.

Capability Maturity Model Integration CMMI
These areas are.
Initial
Managed
Defined
