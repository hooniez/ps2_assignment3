### Software Platforms
Software security depends on secure application platforms.
### Development methodologies

1. Waterfall Model
  * Waterfall The waterfall methodology is a linear project management approach, where stakeholder and customer requirements are gathered at the beginning of the project, and then a sequential project plan is created to accommodate those requirements. The waterfall model is so named because each phase of the project cascades into the next, following steadily down like a waterfall.
2. Spiral Model
  * The spiral model is a risk-driven software development process model. Based on the unique risk patterns of a given project, the spiral model guides a team to adopt elements of one or more process models, such as incremental, waterfall, or evolutionary prototyping.
3. Agile Model
  * Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development that helps teams deliver value to their customers faster and with fewer headaches. Instead of betting everything on a "big bang" launch, an agile team delivers work in small, but consumable, increments. Requirements, plans, and results are evaluated continuously so teams have a natural mechanism for responding to change quickly.

### Maturity Models
Maturity Models help assess an organisation's process maturity

1. The Capability Maturity Model Integration
  1. Initial
    * Work gets done but is subject to delays and budget overruns.
  2. Managed
    * Various types of mangement (Configuration management, Process and Product quality assurance)
  3. Defined
    * Decision analysis and resolution, Organisationsal training
  4. Quantitively Manged
    * Organisational process performance
  5. Optimising

2. IDEAL Model
  1. Initiating
  2. Diagnosing
  3. Establishing 
  4. Action
  5. Learning 

3. Software Assurance Maturity Model
  * SAMM seeks to provide a framework for integrating security activitives into the software development and maintenance process, as well as offer organisations the ability to access their maturity levels in these areas  

### Change Mangement
1. Request Control
  * manages, evaluates, and prioritizes inbound requests from customers. 
2. Change Control
  * grants permission for developers to make changes to application code.
3. Release Control
  * moves the code from the developement environment into production

### SC1:Participation Activitiy
|Scenario|Type of Threat|Mitigation Techniques|Issues related to the threat|
|---|---|---|---|
|The attacker attempts to guess passwords|Elevation of privilege|Enforce the strong password policy|The attacker can set a foothold into the network to wage a more sophisticated attack|
|The attacker spoofs a server|Authentication|Monitoring netwroks for atypical activity|Confidential information can be leaked|
|Attacker posts HTML or script to your site|Denial of Service|Do not allow any dynamic code exeuction in the application|Your website can be made unavailable for users|
|Access to or modification of confidential HTTP data|Tampering with data|Use a secure protocol like HTTPS|Data integrity is at risk|
|Flood service with too many connections|Denial of service|Overprovision Bandwidth|Your website can be down for an extended period of time|
